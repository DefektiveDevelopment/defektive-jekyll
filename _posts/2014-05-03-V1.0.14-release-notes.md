### TLDR

- Version Bump (14)
- The end will now move up with the level height
- Lots of improvements
- Cleaned up code/assets

### Summary


When hitting the star at the end of the level, and going through the door. The level end will move up 5 blocks. 

Added liquid blocks back in. Fixed a bug where the first liquid block would be the wrong type. 

Shooting has been improved (if not fixed). You can now shoot backwards!! I had to rebuild the character and gun to make this possible.

Cleaned up code.... a lot. Moved some code out to my first Unirty Plugin. Its located [here](https://github.com/DefektiveDevelopment/UnityEditorCustomTypes). Deleted tests that came with some assets. Removed some assets that I am no longer using. 

Input has been completely revamped. Swithed to using [InControl](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/14695), best $15 I've spent in the asset store. The game now supports a large number of controllers. Including

- nyko playpad
- xbox 360
- nvidia shield
