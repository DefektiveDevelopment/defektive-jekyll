### TLDR

- Pen-tuple jump!!!
- Levels are now 150 blocks wide
- Gems will make you invicible
- The level height increases when you reach the end
- Leaderboards refactor

### Summary

Infinte jump made the levels seem to easy, and double jump made it impossible. I settled on pen-tuple jump (5 jumps). Be careful though its hard to see where you're going to land if you jmp too high.

Gems will make you invincible for 10 seconds. If you collect a gem while already invicible, it will add to your invincibility time.

I messed with level generation. I settled on 150 blocks wide. I removed the seed change when you reach the end. Instead it increase the level height by
5 blocks.

Lots of work on leader boards. I think they are done.

Fixed some issues with loading data on resume or restart of the game.
